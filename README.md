Rails Companion
Welcome to Rails Companion — a personal learning guide and Ruby on Rails app built from the ground up as I learn Ruby on Rails.
This app is both a project and a learning tool:
Each feature demonstrates core Rails or Ruby concepts.
Pages are organized by learning "Levels" and topics.
Content is interactive, editable, and tied to real Rails code.

🚀 Getting Started (in Codespaces)
Click the "Code" button above.

Select Codespaces → Create codespace on main.
Once the environment opens, run:
rails new . --css=tailwind --force
Then start the development server:
bin/dev

Visit http://localhost:3000 (Codespaces will display the open port in the top bar → click “Ports”).

📘 Why This Exists
Rails Companion helps me:
Practice and retain what I’m learning.
Build real features in small steps.
Keep a reference I can return to at any time.
